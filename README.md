# Impacts of Geopolitical Tensions on Cross-Asset Allocations
### An Option-Implied Geopolitical Risk Dashboard


A Black-Scholes-based research project measuring how the 2026 Middle Eastern conflict and Strait of Hormuz disruptions moved oil, airline, consumer, healthcare, and broad-market risk &mdash; and testing whether standard option hedges would have actually protected a hypothetical wealth-management client portfolio through it.

## Selected results

| | |
|---|---|
| **USO move around the war's outbreak** | +29%, vs. an oil-vol proxy (OVX) that jumped 36 points |
| **Protective SPY put, same event** | -1.0x protection efficiency (it made things *worse*) |
| **Oil-linked call overlay, same event** | +7.26x protection efficiency |
| **Same option, two volatility inputs** | 64.5% difference in the model price |

## The research question

> How does the options market price geopolitical oil-supply risk, how does that risk transmit
> across sectors, and which option strategies most efficiently hedge a diversified private-client
> portfolio?

Three hypotheses were tested against real data rather than assumed:

1. **H1**: Middle East escalation raises implied volatility most directly in oil and energy assets.
2. **H2**: Airlines and consumer discretionary show more downside concern from higher energy costs
   and squeezed consumer spending.
3. **H3**: Healthcare behaves more defensively than airlines, consumer discretionary, and broad
   equities.

## Key findings

- **Oil absorbed the shock first and hardest.** USO moved +29% and its volatility proxy (OVX)
  jumped 36 points around the war's outbreak (Feb 28&ndash;Mar 2, 2026) &mdash; by far the largest
  reaction of any asset in the study.
- **A protective SPY put would have barely helped, or even hurt.** The broad market itself moved
  less than 1% during the same event. A hedge built to protect against a market crash missed
  where the actual risk was.
- **An oil-linked call overlay outperformed dramatically** in the same scenario (protection
  efficiency of 7.26x, vs. -1.0x for the SPY put) &mdash; because the real risk was concentrated in
  oil, not the broad market.
- **Black-Scholes' constant-volatility assumption visibly failed around the event.** The same
  option, priced with pre-event vs. post-event volatility, produced prices 64.5% apart. Even daily
  delta-hedging couldn't fully absorb a real overnight jump in oil prices (+13%, Mar 5&rarr;6, 2026).

```

Notebooks 02&ndash;07 import their core calculations from `src/geopolitical_options/` rather than
redefining them inline (Notebook 01 is the one exception: it *builds* the engine from scratch, as
Phase 1's own subject, and `src/black_scholes.py`/`greeks.py` mirror that same implementation).
This keeps one tested source of truth for the math instead of seven slightly-drifting copies.

## What's real data vs. synthetic data, and why

**Notebooks 05, 06, and 07, and the dashboard, run on real historical price data**: actual daily
closing prices for USO, JETS, SPY, XLE, XLY, XLV, and GLD, plus VIX and OVX as volatility proxies,
pulled via `yfinance` (see `scripts/fetch_event_data.py`).

**Notebooks 02, 03, and 04 run on synthetic data**, generated directly from the `src/` Black-Scholes
engine plus a hand-coded volatility smile. This is because historical *per-strike option chain*
data (needed for a real implied-volatility surface) generally requires paid access &mdash; ORATS,
CBOE DataShop, OptionMetrics, or a Bloomberg/Refinitiv terminal &mdash; which wasn't available for
this project. Free tools like `yfinance` only expose **live** option chains, not historical ones.

This substitution is real and worth being upfront about in any interview: the pricing engine,
the cleaning pipeline, and the implied-vol solver are all genuinely functional, unit-tested code
(see `tests/`, 56 tests / 98% coverage, run automatically in CI), demonstrated on realistic
synthetic data rather than hidden behind a "trust me" placeholder. The research conclusions that
actually matter (Notebooks 05&ndash;07) are drawn from real market data, not the synthetic set.

### A note on precision: "historically calibrated," not "historically traded"

Notebook 06's hedge comparison prices each hedge (protective put, collar, oil call overlay) using
the `src/black_scholes.py` engine, with:

- **strikes** set mechanically at 5% out-of-the-money from the current spot,
- **volatility inputs** taken from VIX/OVX levels (broad proxies, not this project's own
  per-security implied volatility),
- **no bid-ask spread, transaction costs, or early-exercise modeling**, and
- **scenario returns** calibrated from real, measured Phase 5 event moves, applied over a
  30-calendar-day hedge horizon that doesn't exactly match the ~10-trading-day windows those
  moves were measured over (a documented simplification).

That combination is best described as a **historically calibrated hedge simulation** &mdash; the
scenarios are real, the pricing engine is real and tested, but the specific option premiums were
never quoted or tradable, since this project has no historical option-chain data. Worth stating
precisely rather than calling every number in that section "real."

## Running the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elena-ivosevic/geopolitical_options_lab.git
cd geopolitical_options_lab
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # installs src/geopolitical_options + pytest
pytest tests/                  # 56 tests, should all pass
jupyter notebook notebooks/    # open and run any notebook
```

Notebooks 05&ndash;07 depend on the CSVs in `data/real_historical_prices/`, which are already
included in this repo. To refresh them with more recent data:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_event_data.py
```

(Requires `yfinance` and `pandas`; see the script's docstring for details.)

## The dashboard

`dashboard/index.html` is a single self-contained file (no build step, no server) with five
views:

1. **Market Overview** &mdash; real price paths and volatility proxies across the full period
2. **Pricing Calculator** &mdash; the Black-Scholes engine, live and interactive, in the browser
3. **Event Study** &mdash; the real volatility-transmission analysis, switchable per event
4. **Hedge Simulator** &mdash; the $1M portfolio comparison, rescalable to any portfolio size
5. **Model Risk** &mdash; the delta-hedging-through-a-jump and constant-volatility-failure results


## Limitations

- Historical per-strike option-chain data (real skew, real vega, real quoted premiums) isn't
  included &mdash; see the synthetic-data and hedge-precision notes above.
- VIX and OVX are broad volatility-index proxies, not this project's own measured implied
  volatility for each specific asset.
- The "Mild Escalation" scenario in the hedging notebook is an interpolation (35% of the real
  Major Disruption event's magnitude), since no event in this project's real sample was actually
  mild &mdash; labeled explicitly wherever it's used.
- The event study currently compares simple before/after windows around three events rather than
  a full benchmark-adjusted event-study specification (abnormal returns vs. an estimation window,
  bootstrap confidence intervals, sensitivity to window length, non-event-period comparison).
  That rigor would strengthen the statistical claims further and is a natural next iteration.
- The hedging simulation does not model bid-ask spreads, transaction costs, or early exercise.
